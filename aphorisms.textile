* Two cowards: One who, for fear of the truth, lies. One who, for fear of lying, never speaks.
* Woman’s Love is equalled only by Man’s Lust
* Only a fraud finds more friends than foes. 
* When one speaks of ‘human nature’ it is merely a personal confession. 
* A man respects in others what he admires in himself - and envies in others their attainment of his ideal. 
* A man exiled from sociability will come to believe it self-imposed.
* Each perspective believes itself the Absolute Truth 
* Rivalry is the romance of friendship.
