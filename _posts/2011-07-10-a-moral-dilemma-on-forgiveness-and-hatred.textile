h2. A Moral Dilemma On Forgiveness and Hatred

p. On Forgiveness and Hatred (and most everything else I suppose) my mind follows a dual path. On one hand I separate Action from Doer and can reason thus: I hate the Act of Murder but not _that_ Murderer. In examples of Personal Hatred (possibly a too-strong word â€“ Aversion is more on the money) I reason that it is not person A that I 'hate' but simply his actions (many or all of them). 

On the other hand that sounds a little idealistic and a little like saying I don't hate person A but simply what he Is (his actions...). 

When it comes to Forgiveness then I follow a strict All-Forgiving policy blaming no man for his actions ( being without 'free will' and other nonsense).  But this is again dependant on idealistic abstraction which (being a strict materialist) I am generally opposed to.    
 
_Is there anything I'm missing?_
